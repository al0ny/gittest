# Why using Docker

# what is a docker file / Image

# What is container

# Difference between image and container
Image is the actual package, it includes the configuration file, the application we want to run and maybe some start scripts.
Its actually the artifact

A container is actually whats being created after I pull the image to the docker server and start the application. This actually creates the container.
