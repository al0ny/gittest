# Why using Docker

# what is a docker file / Image
It's the artifact. It contains the application I want to run, configurations file and maybe some startup scripts.
It got multiple layers, the application layer (such as mysql) and the base system layer (such as alpine linux - which is very light)

# What is container

# Difference between image and container
Image is the actual package, it includes the configuration file, the application we want to run and maybe some start scripts.
Its actually the artifact

When I run the image it creates the container environment with all layers.  


###
When we fetch / pull an image, it will pull all of that image layers (applications, base system, dependencies, etc.)
If we fetch another application, or even the same application but different version, and some images layers were already pulled by previous installation - it will not download them again - it will just download the 
image layers it neds for that specific application.

# Difference between Image and Container
 - A Container is a running env of an image.
   It has its own abstraction of an operating system and how to use and access system files.
